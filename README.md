## Installation

To build this project from the source code in this repository you need to have
- a Fortran compiler supporting Fortran 2008
- [meson](https://mesonbuild.com) version 0.53 or newer
- a build-system backend, *i.e.* [ninja](https://ninja-build.org) version 1.7 or newer

Setup a build with

```
meson setup _build
```

You can select the Fortran compiler by the `FC` environment variable, currently this project supports GCC, Intel and PGI/NVHPC compilers.
To compile the project run

```
meson compile -C _build
```

You can run the projects testsuite with

```
meson test -C _build --print-errorlogs
```

Alternatively, this project can be build with CMake (in this case ninja 1.10 or newer is required):

```
cmake -B _build -G Ninja
```

To compile the project with CMake run

```
cmake --build _build
```

You can run the project testsuite with

```
pushd _build && ctest && popd
```


## Example

An example application is provided with the [``mctc-convert``](man/mctc-convert.1.adoc) program to convert between different supported input formats.

To read an input file using the IO library use the ``read_structure`` routine.
The final geometry data is stored in a ``structure_type``:

```fortran
use mctc_io
use mctc_env
type(structure_type) :: mol
type(error_type), allocatable :: error

call read_structure(mol, "input.xyz", error)
if (allocated(error)) then
   print '("[Error]", 1x, a)', error%message
   error stop
end if
```

The environment library provides a basic error back-propagation mechanism using an allocatable ``error_type``, which is passed to the library routines.
Usually the reader can detect the file type from the suffix of file names.
Alternatively, the ``filetype`` enumerator provides the identifiers of all supported file types, which can be passed as optional argument to the ``read_structure`` routine.

In a similar way the ``write_structure`` routine allows to write a ``structure_type`` to a file or unit:

``` fortran
use mctc_io
use mctc_env
type(structure_type) :: mol
type(error_type), allocatable :: error

call write_structure(mol, "output.xyz", error)
if (allocated(error)) then
   print '("[Error]", 1x, a)', error%message
   error stop
end if
```

The [``mctc-convert``](man/mctc-convert.1.adoc) program provides a chained reader and writer call to act as a geometry file converter.
Checkout the implementation in [``app/main.f90``](app/main.f90).
